# Labyrinth
Labyrinth is a 2 to 4 person, multiplayer board game. Your goal is to maneuver around the labyrinth, moving and shifting the maze each turn, to collect all 7 of your assigned items and return home. Sounds simple doesn't it? Wrong! Because everyone else is also making changes to the maze, in order to collect their items! The maze is made up of a grid of tiles, with one tile off to the side. Each turn you can shift a row or column of these tiles by slotting the extra tile in place. You are then able to move the player using the arrow keys.
